# Daily Progress - Product Overview

## What We're Building

Daily Progress is a **daily-first personal dashboard** designed to help individuals remember what matters today and make calm, consistent progress without pressure, streaks, or productivity guilt.

## Core Philosophy

- **Daily-first, not deadline-first** - Items stay visible across days when scheduled
- **Progress over completion** - Log progress, not just binary done/not-done
- **Recognition over reward** - Acknowledge progress without gamification
- **Memory support over productivity pressure** - Help users remember, don't judge them
- **Respect for work/life boundaries** - Items appear only on their scheduled days

## Key Principle

> **"Progress is acknowledged, not judged."**

If progress happens — even a small one — it counts. This is not a todo list, productivity tracker, or habit streak app. It's a memory and progress support system.

## Three Types of Items

1. **Timeline Events** - Time-anchored events (meetings, appointments) with recurrence support
2. **Progress Items** - Ongoing work organized by Eisenhower Matrix (importance × urgency)
3. **Commitments** - Recurring routines with no end goal (exercise, medication)

## Target User

Individual users (personal use) who are busy adults with multiple daily roles, struggling with remembering plans and progress, and who value calm systems over aggressive productivity tools.

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ A gamified productivity app
- ❌ A habit streak tracker  
- ❌ A project management tool
- ❌ A performance measurement system
- ❌ A team collaboration platform

## Success Metrics

Success is measured by daily usefulness, reduced forgotten responsibilities, and consistent low-stress engagement — NOT by streaks, completion rates, or productivity scores.
